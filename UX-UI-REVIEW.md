## ‚ùå **CRITICAL ISSUES & GAPS**

### **1. Core Music Creation Workflow**

#### **Issues:**
- ‚ùå **Pattern generation inconsistency** - unclear if AI generation actually works
- ‚ùå **Audio playback gaps** - no clear feedback when patterns play/stop
- ‚ùå **Limited preset library** - few example patterns to learn from
- ‚ùå **No real-time editing** - can't modify patterns once generated

#### **Impact:** 
Users can't complete a full creative workflow from idea to finished pattern.

### **2. Learning Curve & Onboarding**

#### **Issues:**
- ‚ùå **No guided tutorial** - new users don't know where to start
- ‚ùå **Command discovery** - unclear what commands are available
- ‚ùå **No progressive complexity** - beginners overwhelmed by advanced features
- ‚ùå **Missing context help** - no hints for common workflows

#### **Impact:** 
High abandonment rate for new users who can't figure out basic operations.

### **3. Audio System Integration**

#### **Issues:**
- ‚ùå **Inconsistent audio feedback** - unclear when music is playing
- ‚ùå **No visual waveforms** - can't see pattern structure
- ‚ùå **Limited audio controls** - basic play/stop without fine control
- ‚ùå **No export options** - can't save audio files or share results

#### **Impact:** 
Platform feels like a demo rather than a functional music creation tool.

### **4. Collaboration Features**

#### **Issues:**
- ‚ùå **Mock collaboration** - presence indicators and activity feeds are simulated
- ‚ùå **No real-time sync** - can't actually collaborate with other users
- ‚ùå **Missing sharing mechanism** - no way to share patterns with others
- ‚ùå **No community discovery** - can't find other creators or their work

#### **Impact:** 
Collaboration features are UI-only without functional backend.

### **5. Mobile Experience Gaps**

#### **Issues:**
- ‚ùå **Touch gestures inconsistent** - some gestures don't work reliably
- ‚ùå **Input challenges** - typing commands on mobile is cumbersome
- ‚ùå **Layout issues** - side panel may not be optimal on small screens
- ‚ùå **Performance on mobile** - may be slower on lower-end devices

#### **Impact:** 
Mobile users have a degraded experience compared to desktop.
